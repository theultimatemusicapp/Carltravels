            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Carlos Tomich, an Australian-born filmmaker, traveler, and music enthusiast with a rich British/Croatian background. My passion for storytelling, exploration, and technology has shaped my journey through life and my career.</p>

            <h2>My Background</h2>
            <p>I’ve traveled to over 40 countries and explored more than 300 cities worldwide. From driving across the entire expanse of Australia to sailing around half of its coast, I’ve always sought adventure. My experiences include living in Germany for 10 years, spending six months in the Canary Islands, and calling Budapest, Vietnam, and New York home during extended stays. These diverse experiences have deeply influenced my creative work and my perspective on life.</p>

            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>I started my creative journey as a teenager, playing in bands, DJing across the globe, and busking on city streets. These formative years fueled my love for music and led me to discover my passion for filmmaking and vlogging. Over the years, I have released three feature documentary films and am currently working on my fourth. Travel remains a cornerstone of my life, inspiring my work and feeding my curiosity about the world.</p>

            <h2>Passion for Film and Technology</h2>
            <p>Filmmaking has become a way for me to blend my love for storytelling, technology, and gear. Through my company, <a href="https://www.nextdaycinematics.com" target="_blank">Next Day Cinematics</a>, I aim to create visually compelling stories that captivate and inspire. My YouTube channels are a testament to this passion, where I share travel adventures, filmmaking tips, and gear reviews with a growing community of viewers.</p>
