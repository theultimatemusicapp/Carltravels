                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Weipa, situated on the Gulf of Carpentaria in Far North Queensland, is Australia's northernmost town and a gateway to the remote Outback. Known for its rich Indigenous culture and stunning natural landscapes, Weipa offers a unique blend of adventure and cultural immersion. As Carl, a 38-year-old traveler from Australia, I embarked on a 3-day journey to explore the wonders of Weipa and its surrounding regions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Brief History:</strong> Weipa was established in the late 1950s as a mining town to support the bauxite industry. Over the decades, it has grown into a vibrant community, maintaining strong ties to its Indigenous heritage and natural surroundings.</p>
