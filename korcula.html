                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>In this episode, I'm taking you on a deeply personal journey to <strong>Korčula</strong>. This island isn't just a place of stunning beauty; it holds the roots of my family tree.</p>

                    <h2>Tracing My Ancestral Roots</h2>
                    <p>My roots extend across the ocean to New Zealand, where my grandfather made his home after leaving Korčula as a young man.</p>
                    <p>For years, all I knew of my grandfather's past were the stories that faded like old photographs. He left Korčula early in life, carrying little more than his name and memories, which he seldom spoke of.</p>

                    <h2>Preparing for the Journey</h2>
                    <p>So we're going to go to a car shop, see if we can hire a car for the day, for tomorrow, and drive to Chara, and maybe do a vineyard tour or something. My connection to him and his land felt as distant as the sea that stretches between our two homes.</p>

                    <h2>Exploring the Old Town</h2>
                    <p>We began in the old town, spending two nights enveloped in its medieval charm.</p>
                    <p>The history here is strong, through stones worn by centuries of footsteps. Leaving the town behind, we hired a car and drove to Chara, the village where my grandfather was born.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                    <p><strong>Korčula's</strong> story begins in antiquity, with Illyrian tribes who first settled these lands, carving out a rudimentary society amidst the dense forests and rugged coastlines.</p>
                    <p>The Venetians, ever expansive in their maritime endeavors, christened it "Black Korčula," inspired by the dense woods that cloaked the island. They established a stronghold on this strategic outpost, which later grew under Ottoman influence, following their paths in trade and conquest.</p>

                    <h2>Journey to Chara</h2>
                    <p>The roads lined with fields and vineyards seem to whisper stories of those who had walked them before us.</p>
                    <p>We're going to see if we can find some relatives. In Chara, the past seemed to wait for us. With nothing but an old photograph and hope, we met an elderly lady who, despite the language barrier, recognized the face in the picture.</p>

                    <h2>Discovering Family</h2>
                    <p>With a kind, wrinkled finger, she pointed us down a path that led to a discovery beyond words.</p>
                    <p><strong>Hello. I'm Ingrid. Carl. Nice to meet you. James. Hello. Ingrid. Hi, Ingrid. Nice to meet you.</strong></p>
                    <p>So welcome. Yeah, I don't know if they told you. Me and him, we're all Tormich. Our family, my ditto, comes from Chara.</p>

                    <h2>Vineyard Tour</h2>
                    <p>Just having a holiday, holiday around Croatia. Do you want a tasting or? All of a free wine. Is that okay? Yeah, free wines. Yes.</p>
                    <p>At <strong>Morellec Winery</strong>, we found not just wine, but family. Ingrid and her husband, descendants of my great family's lineage, welcomed us. We are connected.</p>

                    <h2>Winery Experience</h2>
                    <p>You can see all the bottles from Winery exist. Oh, wow. 1997. Wow. May I take some pictures? Yes, of course.</p>
                    <p>Sharing stories, we bridge decades of separation with every glass poured, each sip a taste of heritage. Our journey culminated at the cemetery, where generations of my ancestors rest. Standing among the graves, the story my grandfathers never told seemed to rise from the earth itself. Here, amidst the silence of those who had gone before, I found a connection that time, no distance, could sever.</p>

                    <h2>Visiting the Cemetery</h2>
                    <p>So this is a bit of a surreal moment for me. I'm walking in the gravestone of my distant relatives, and there's actually quite a few of them here.</p>
                    <p>So I'll show you some of them. Yeah, they're all my granddad's brothers and cousins and, yeah, great grandfather. Wow.</p>

                    <p>This trip was more than a search for my roots. It was a pilgrimage of understanding. A path walked with my brothers, a recognition of a past that will shape our futures. Thank you for joining me on this profound journey back to where my family stood.
