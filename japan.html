                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    Japan's recorded history stretches back thousands of years, beginning with the mythological creation stories of Shintoism and continuing through the rise of the Imperial court. Over centuries, the nation has been shaped by influential periods like the Heian era, when art and literature flourished, and the feudal era, marked by samurai rule under powerful shogunates. As European traders arrived in the 16th century, new technologies and religious ideas briefly entered the archipelago, only to be restricted during the Tokugawa Shogunate’s policy of national seclusion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the mid-19th century, the forced opening of Japan to foreign trade led to the Meiji Restoration (1868), a rapid modernization and industrialization process that transformed the country into a major world power. Despite devastating losses during World War II, Japan’s post-war economic miracle propelled it to the forefront of technology and global trade. Today, Japan is known for its blend of ancient tradition—seen in its temples, shrines, and festivals—and cutting-edge innovation that shapes modern life.

                <!-- Population Section -->
                <h2>Population</h2>
                <p>
                    As of 2023, Japan has an estimated population of around 125 million people. Most residents live in sprawling metropolitan areas such as Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya. While the country has a high life expectancy, it also faces demographic challenges, including an aging population and low birth rate.

                <!-- Transportation Section -->
                <h2>Transportation</h2>
                <p>
                    Getting around Japan is famously efficient, thanks to its excellent rail network. High-speed Shinkansen (bullet trains) connect major cities, while local trains and subways in urban centers make intra-city travel easy. Buses complement rail services in smaller towns, and domestic flights are often used for travel between distant regions, such as Tokyo to Hokkaido or Okinawa. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Visitors can purchase a Japan Rail Pass for unlimited use on JR trains over a specified period, offering great value for those planning to explore multiple regions. Taxis are readily available but can be expensive. In larger cities, walking and biking are also popular ways to see the sights at a more leisurely pace.
                </p>

                <!-- Culture Section -->
                <h2>Culture</h2>
                <p>
                    Japanese culture balances deep-rooted traditions with modern innovation. Respect, politeness, and harmony play important roles in daily life. Seasonal festivals, tea ceremonies, calligraphy, and traditional theater (like Kabuki and Noh) showcase Japan’s rich heritage. Meanwhile, cutting-edge technology, anime, manga, and J-pop represent the country’s contemporary cultural exports.
                </p>

                <!-- Where to Stay Section -->
                <h2>Where to Stay</h2>
                <p>
                    From futuristic capsule hotels in Tokyo to traditional ryokans (inns) with tatami floors and onsen baths, Japan offers a variety of unique accommodations. Major cities have everything from luxury international chains to budget-friendly hostels. Staying in a ryokan is a wonderful way to experience local hospitality and cuisine, often served as multi-course kaiseki meals.
                </p>

           

                <!-- Currency Section -->
                <h2>Currency</h2>
                <p>
                    Japan’s currency is the Japanese Yen (JPY). Credit cards are widely accepted in most hotels, department stores, and restaurants, but it’s wise to carry some cash for smaller businesses and in more rural areas.

                <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
                <p>
                    The spring months (March to May) bring cherry blossoms and mild weather, making it a popular season for tourists. Autumn (September to November) dazzles with colorful foliage. Winter offers world-class skiing in places like Hokkaido, while summer is warm and humid, punctuated by lively festivals.
                </p>
                
                <!-- Prices Overview Section -->
                <h2>Average Prices</h2>
                <p>
                    Mid-range hotels typically cost between USD $80–$150 per night. Luxury accommodations in central Tokyo can climb much higher. Dining can range from USD $10 for a hearty bowl of ramen to USD $100+ for a high-end sushi experience. Public transportation is efficient and fairly priced, but intercity travel on the Shinkansen can be expensive—unless you have a Japan Rail Pass.
                </p>
