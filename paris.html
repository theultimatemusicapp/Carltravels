                <!-- Safety -->
                <section>
                    <h2>Safety</h2>
                    <p>Paris is generally a safe city for tourists, but like any major metropolitan area, it has its share of petty crimes, particularly pickpocketing and scams. Being vigilant and taking basic precautions can help ensure a safe and enjoyable visit.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Common Scams to Watch Out For</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pickpocketing:</strong> Common in crowded areas such as tourist attractions, public transportation, and busy streets. Always keep an eye on your belongings and use anti-theft bags.</li>
                        <li><strong>Deaf and Dumb Blind Association Clipboard Scam:</strong> Scammers pose as members of a charitable organization, using clipboards to appear legitimate. They may request donations or offer free services. Always verify the legitimacy of any charity by researching it online before contributing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fake Police Officers:</strong> Individuals dressed in uniform may approach tourists, claiming there's an issue with their wallet or passport. Legitimate police officers will never ask for payment on the spot. If approached, calmly walk away and contact local authorities if necessary.</li>
                        <li><strong>ATM Skimming:</strong> Scammers install devices on ATMs to capture card information. Use ATMs located in well-lit, secure areas and inspect the machine for any unusual attachments before use.</li>
                        <li><strong>Street Games:</strong> Some scams involve street games like shelling or coin-throwing, where after winning a small prize, you're pressured to pay a "winnings fee" or make additional purchases.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Tips to Stay Safe</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>**Stay Alert:** Be aware of your surroundings, especially in crowded places.</li>
                        <li>**Secure Your Belongings:** Use bags with zippers and keep them close to your body.</li>
                        <li>**Avoid Flashy Displays:** Minimize wearing expensive jewelry or displaying large amounts of cash.</li>
                        <li>**Use Reputable Services:** Only use official taxis or rideshare services, and verify driver details before entering the vehicle.</li>
                        <li>**Trust Your Instincts:** If something feels off, remove yourself from the situation immediately.</li>

                    <h2>Currency and Money Matters</h2>
                    <p>The official currency in Paris, as in the rest of France, is the Euro (€). Here's what you need to know about managing your finances during your trip:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Currency Exchange</h3>

                    <p>ATMs are readily accessible throughout the city, especially in major districts and tourist areas. Most ATMs accept international debit and credit cards. However, it's a good practice to inform your bank of your travel plans to avoid any issues with card usage abroad.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Credit Cards</h3>
                    <p>Credit cards (Visa and Mastercard) are widely accepted in hotels, restaurants, and larger shops. However, smaller establishments and street vendors may prefer cash, so it's recommended to carry some euros for such situations.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Tips</h3>
                    <p>Tipping in Paris is appreciated but not mandatory. A tip of 5-10% is common for good service in restaurants, while rounding up the bill is sufficient for cafes and casual dining.</p>
