                <section>
                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Kuranda, nestled in the heart of the Atherton Tablelands in Far North Queensland, is a charming village renowned for its lush rainforest, vibrant markets, and scenic landscapes. As Carl, a 38-year-old traveler from Australia, I embarked on a 3-day rainforest retreat to immerse myself in the natural beauty and cultural richness of Kuranda.</p>
                    <p><strong>Brief History:</strong> Kuranda has a rich history influenced by its Indigenous heritage and European settlers who established it as a hub for gold mining in the late 19th century. Today, it is a popular destination for eco-tourism and cultural experiences.</p>
