                    <h2>A Brief History of the City</h2>
                    <p>Founded by the Romans over two millennia ago, London has evolved into one of the world's most influential cities. It has witnessed significant historical eventsâ€”from medieval times to the modern eraâ€”and its rich history is evident in its architecture, museums, and cultural traditions.</p>

                <!-- Carl's London Story -->
                <section class="section">
                    <h2>Carl's London Story</h2>
                    <p>In April 2011, I touched down in London with two friendsâ€”Andrew, a fellow musician from Perth, and Melissa from Melbourne. It was all of our first time in Europe, and London felt like the perfect starting point. The city was buzzing, not just with its usual energy but with something extraâ€”the upcoming Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton.</p>
                    <p>With the Australian dollar at an all-time high, everything felt surprisingly affordable, which only added to the excitement. We threw ourselves into the experience, balancing tourist must-sees with the alternative side of London. One of the first stops was Camdenâ€”my personal holy ground as an indie rock fan. The markets, the street art, the music venuesâ€”it was the London I had imagined. Stepping into legendary indie rock bars, I felt like I was part of something bigger, soaking up the raw, unpolished energy of the scene.</p>
                    <p>But of course, we couldnâ€™t leave without doing the classic tourist rounds. We visited Buckingham Palace, where the crowds were already swelling in anticipation of the wedding. And then, as a die-hard Beatles fan, I had one missionâ€”Abbey Road. What seemed like a simple idea turned into a hilarious challenge. It took about an hour, a lot of patience, and some teamwork with fellow tourists, but eventually, we got the iconic crosswalk photo. Standing outside Abbey Road Studios, knowing that some of the greatest music in history was made behind those doors, was a surreal moment.</p>
                    <p>Beyond the music, London had a personal significance for me. My mum was originally from Bristol, but she had spent time in London. Walking through these streets, knowing she had once been here too, added a layer of nostalgia to the trip.</p>
                    <p>And then, there was the wedding. On the day, the entire city came alive. Streets were packed, people waved flags, and the atmosphere was electric. We joined the masses outside, watching the spectacle unfold in real time. Whether you were a royalist or not, it was impossible not to get swept up in the excitement of history being made.</p>
                    <p>Looking back, those two weeks in London were the perfect mix of adventure, nostalgia, and pure excitement. It was a city that felt larger than lifeâ€”a place where indie rock, Beatles nostalgia, and royal history collided. And for my first taste of Europe, it couldnâ€™t have been more unforgettable.</p>
