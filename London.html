                    <p>Founded by the Romans over two millennia ago, London has evolved into one of the world's most influential cities. It has witnessed significant historical events—from medieval times to the modern era—and its rich history is evident in its architecture, museums, and cultural traditions.</p>

                <!-- Carl's London Story (Updated) -->
                <section class="section">
                    <h2>Carl's London Story</h2>
                    <p><strong>April 2011:</strong> I arrived in London with two friends—Andrew, a fellow musician from Perth, and Melissa from Melbourne. It was all our first time in Europe, and London felt like the perfect starting point. The city was abuzz with anticipation for the upcoming <strong>Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton</strong>, which added a layer of excitement to everything we did.</p>
                    <p>With the Australian dollar at an all-time high, London felt surprisingly affordable—a rarity, I'm told! We decided to split our time between the classic tourist must-sees and the more alternative side of the city. One of my personal highlights was <strong>Camden</strong>, which has always been on my bucket list as an indie rock fan. Stepping into the legendary bars and market stalls felt like stepping into a dream—raw, creative, and full of character.</p>
                    <p>Of course, we also hit the big-name spots. We couldn't miss <strong>Buckingham Palace</strong>, where the crowds were already swelling in anticipation of the wedding day. And as a lifelong Beatles fan, I had one must-do: <strong>Abbey Road</strong>. Getting that iconic crosswalk photo turned out to be a hilarious challenge—there were so many other fans trying to do the exact same thing! After multiple takes and some coordination with fellow tourists, we finally nailed the shot. Standing outside <em>Abbey Road Studios</em>, imagining all the legendary music recorded there, gave me chills.</p>
                    <p>Another layer of nostalgia for me was that my mum originally came from Bristol, but she spent time in London. Knowing she had once walked these streets too made it feel personal. And then there was the wedding itself—on the day, the city erupted in celebration. Streets were packed with well-wishers and curious onlookers, flags were everywhere, and you couldn't help but be swept up in the historical moment.</p>
                    <p>In the end, those two weeks in London were the perfect blend of touristy excitement, indie music discovery, and royal festivities. The city felt larger than life, a place where <strong>Camden’s gritty rock bars</strong> and <strong>royal pageantry</strong> coexisted effortlessly. For my first taste of Europe, it was everything I had hoped for—and then some.</p>
