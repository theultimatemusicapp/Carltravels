                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    The Korean Peninsula’s history dates back thousands of years, with early kingdoms such as Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla vying for dominance. These Three Kingdoms laid the cultural foundations of Korea, including the adoption of Buddhism and the early development of the Korean language. Later, the Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392) contributed to cultural and technological achievements such as the creation of the world’s first metal movable type. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Joseon Dynasty (1392–1897) emphasized Confucian principles, shaping social structure, government, and education for centuries. Following Japanese occupation (1910–1945) and the aftermath of World War II, the Korean War (1950–1953) resulted in the peninsula’s division into North and South Korea. South Korea embarked on rapid industrialization and economic development, transforming into a global technology and pop-culture powerhouse known as the “Korean Wave.” Today, the nation balances deep-rooted traditions with modern innovation in entertainment, technology, and urban design.

                <!-- Population Section -->
                <h2>Population</h2>
                <p>
                    With a population of around 52 million, South Korea is highly urbanized, and nearly half of its residents live in the greater Seoul metropolitan area. The country has one of the world’s highest population densities, and an increasing number of expatriates and international students call Korea home.

                <!-- Transportation Section -->
                <h2>Transportation</h2>
                <p>
                    South Korea offers an impressive transport network. The KTX high-speed rail connects major cities like Seoul, Busan, and Daegu in a matter of hours. Metropolitan areas have extensive subway and bus systems, known for their punctuality and cleanliness. Taxis are relatively affordable, and many people rely on mobile apps (e.g., Kakao Taxi) for convenience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Domestic flights link Jeju Island and other outlying regions to the mainland. For shorter distances, trains and express buses are efficient choices. Seoul’s T-money card (also usable in other cities) simplifies transit by allowing riders to tap in and out on subways and buses.
                </p>

                <!-- Culture Section -->
                <h2>Culture</h2>
                <p>
                    Confucian values deeply influence South Korean society, emphasizing respect for elders, harmony in relationships, and strong family ties. Modern Korean pop culture—often known as Hallyu or the “Korean Wave”—has gained massive global appeal through K-pop, K-dramas, and films. Traditional music, dance, and martial arts (like Taekkyeon) remain vibrant as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    South Korea’s culinary scene is diverse, from fiery kimchi to savory barbecue. Mealtime is often communal, with side dishes (banchan) shared among everyone at the table. Korean street food, such as tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes) and hotteok (sweet pancakes), is a must-try for newcomers.
                </p>

                <!-- Where to Stay Section -->
                <h2>Where to Stay</h2>
                <p>
                    Accommodation ranges from luxury hotels in major cities to hanok (traditional Korean houses) for an authentic stay. Guesthouses, budget hostels, and modern boutique hotels are widely available. In Seoul, neighborhoods like Hongdae, Itaewon, and Myeongdong offer easy access to shopping, dining, and cultural sites.
                </p>
