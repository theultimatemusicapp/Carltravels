                    <h2>Currency and Money Matters</h2>
                    <p>The official currency in Athens, as in the rest of Greece, is the Euro (â‚¬). Here's what you need to know about managing your finances during your trip:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Currency Exchange</h3>
                    <p>Currency exchange services are widely available in Athens, including at the airport, banks, and authorized exchange counters. It's advisable to exchange a small amount of money upon arrival for immediate expenses.</p>
                    
                    <h3>ATMs and Banking</h3>
                    <p>ATMs are readily accessible throughout the city, especially in major districts and tourist areas. Most ATMs accept international debit and credit cards. However, it's a good practice to inform your bank of your travel plans to avoid any issues with card usage abroad.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Credit Cards</h3>
                    <p>Credit cards (Visa and Mastercard) are widely accepted in hotels, restaurants, and larger shops. However, smaller establishments and street vendors may prefer cash, so it's recommended to carry some euros for such situations.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Tips</h3>
                    <p>Tipping in Athens is appreciated but not mandatory. A tip of 5-10% is common for good service in restaurants, while rounding up the bill is sufficient for cafes and casual dining.</p>
