                    <p>Bangla Road in Patong is the epicenter of Phuket's nightlife. Known for its neon lights, energetic vibe, and unique cultural experiences, this street offers endless entertainment.

Showing him around Bangla Road, where cannabis was legal at the time, was an eye-opening experience for both of us.</p>
                    
                    <p>From live music and street performers to bustling bars and unique shops, Bangla Road is a sensory overload that captures the spirit of Phuket’s nightlife.
