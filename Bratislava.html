                    <h3>Currency Exchange</h3>
                    <p>Currency exchange services are widely available in Bratislava, including at the airport, banks, and authorized exchange counters. It's advisable to exchange a small amount of money upon arrival for immediate expenses.</p>

                    <h3>Credit Cards</h3>

                    <h3>Tips</h3>
