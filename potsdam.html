                    <h2>Safety</h2>
                    <p>Potsdam is generally a safe city for tourists, but like any major metropolitan area, it has its share of petty crimes, particularly pickpocketing and scams. Being vigilant and taking basic precautions can help ensure a safe and enjoyable visit.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Common Scams to Watch Out For</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pickpocketing:</strong> Common in crowded areas such as tourist attractions, public transportation, and busy streets. Always keep an eye on your belongings and use anti-theft bags.</li>
                        <li><strong>Deaf and Dumb Blind Association Clipboard Scam:</strong> Scammers pose as members of a charitable organization, using clipboards to appear legitimate. They may request donations or offer free services. Always verify the legitimacy of any charity by researching it online before contributing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fake Ticket Sellers:</strong> Be cautious of individuals selling tickets for attractions at significantly reduced prices. Always purchase tickets from official sources to avoid counterfeit or invalid entries.</li>
                        <li><strong>ATM Skimming:</strong> Scammers install devices on ATMs to capture card information. Use ATMs located in well-lit, secure areas and inspect the machine for any unusual attachments before use.</li>
                        <li><strong>Street Games:</strong> Some scams involve street games like shelling or coin-throwing, where after winning a small prize, you're pressured to pay a "winnings fee" or make additional purchases.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Tips to Stay Safe</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>**Stay Alert:** Be aware of your surroundings, especially in crowded places.</li>
                        <li>**Secure Your Belongings:** Use bags with zippers and keep them close to your body.</li>
